# Remove HTML Tags for MS Word & LibreOffice Writer

If a document uses HTML tags (i.e. product name, descriptions), these will appear in the Job Ticket when its downloaded as a .doc file. The HTML tags can be removed with the functions here for Microsoft Word (**MSWord.vba**) and LibreOffice Writer (**LibreOfficeWriter.bas**). Install them as macros and create a button to use them on an open document.
